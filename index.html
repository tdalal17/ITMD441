<p>Hello my Name is Tanay Dalal</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I am a senior year student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I am studying for a degree in Information Technology and Management.</p>

<p>In my previous classes ITMD 361 and 362, I learned a lot about web development and design. We focused on writing clean code and created multiple projects including an information page, resume page, about page, and hobbies page.</p>

<p>Through my coursework, I have gained skills in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Web design principles</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm excited to continue growing my skills in web development and build more projects.</p>
